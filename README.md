## Advanced Calculator
📜 Project Overview
The Advanced Calculator is a Python-based program that allows users to perform basic and advanced mathematical operations.
It incorporates robust error handling and a user-friendly interface, making it a reliable tool for performing calculations.
## 🛠️ Features
*** Basic Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/).
Advanced Operations:
Modulo (%)
Exponentiation (**)
Square root (sqrt)
*** Error Handling:
Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
Prevents division by zero.
Manages edge cases like negative square roots.
Interactive Loop: The calculator continues running until the user chooses to exit.

### 🔧 How It Works
The program starts with a welcome message and a list of supported operations.
Users input an operation and the numbers they wish to calculate.
The calculator processes the inputs and displays the result or an error message, if applicable.
Users can continue performing calculations or exit the program.

### 🖥️ Technologies Used

Language: Python 3
Libraries:
math: For advanced mathematical operations.
